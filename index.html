                    I've always been fascinated by computers, ever since a young age when I locked my dad out of our family computer.
                    <br/>
                    Regretting not pursuing it at a younger age, I decided to learn at the start of 2021 after being made redundant in the lockdown.
                    <br/>
                    I started with the basics, HTML, CSS and then was recommended a Udemy course on JavaScript which is when I seriously started to fall in love with programming.
                    <br/>
                    It seems like a lifetime ago now... since then I've mainly been working with JavaScript and Laravel as my first web position was working with Laravel and it was my introduction to back end technologies.

                    <p class="projects-text__content">
                        While working at a digital agency I was asked to reproduce to a design and "code up" a website for one of our clients. This was the first project I done done by myself with very little guidance and I was proud at the time of how it came out.
                        <br/>
                        As any developer though, I would go back and change things. Also there was a lot of code that was written that the client didn't end up using, which was a shame because it was all the trickier parts.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We had a custom built CMS that the agency had worked with for quite some time, and then tailored both the front end "back(admin)" end to the exact specification, they could then go in and change all images, text and titles. This particular project needed the project to have gallery images that could be used as a "collection" or "seasonal" items so I added a checkbox on the gallery which would mark in the database if it was a collection or not.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The tech used on this project was Laravel, JavaScript, Sass and I used GSAP/Greensock.js for the animations.

                    <p class="projects-text__content">
                        For this project, I focused my attention on Laravel and bringing data in from the database. This project is still under progress but coming along nicely.
                        <br/>
                        Like I worked with in the digital agency, I spent my evenings recreating what we were using there with my own code, both to better understand our tech and also to potentially update the one we had their.
                        <br/>
                        In it's current state it has a solid foundation built in for the back end, with controllers built and working for a gallery, content management and also a blog which is nearly completed. This will make it so a client would be able to change all the material and images on the pages, leaving it more practical for an agency to do less work on the completed site once the client has it in their hands.
                        <br/>
                        Overall this project has been my longest one to date, and still needs completing, mainly on the front end.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The tech stack I used for this project is Laravel, JavaScript, GSAP for animations, Sass and I am considering overhauling the project using LiveWire to learn about that technology.

                        The first game I made from scratch, using nothing but documentation. This project was a challenge for me because it was my first whole project I avoided any form of video reference.
                        <br/>
                        It took me around a week from start to finish, and this was quite early on in my development career so I considered that a massive success. There's a couple of bits I would of loved to implement but I started a job shortly after and needed to learn Laravel ASAP.
                        <br/>
                        A few issues I had with this project was the colliders pushing off each other (paddles bouncing backwards) and the computer AI which was created by waiting until the ball hit a certain point before the computer had time to react. One of the features I wanted to add eventually was a difficulty to change how long the computer was tracking the ball for.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Tech I used to create this game was a JavaScript framework called Phaser, a great little tool that I learned a lot about OOP from.
